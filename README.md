# Walmart : predict weekly sales

Project carried out within the framework of my training Data Fullstack, Jedha's Bootcamp Paris. 

The goal was to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales for Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made.

The project is divided into three steps:
Part 1 : EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
Part 2 : linear regression model
Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model











## Installation
